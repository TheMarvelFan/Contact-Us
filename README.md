# Contact Us

This project implements a simple "Contact Us" form using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It includes input validation and displays a success message upon form submission.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your local machine:

- Git
- A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- A text editor or IDE (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, Atom)

## Cloning the Project

To clone this project onto your local environment, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the project.

3. Run the following command to clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/TheMarvelFan/Contact-Us.git
   ```

4. Once the cloning process is complete, navigate into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Contact-Us
   ```

## Project Structure

After cloning, your project structure should look like this:

```
contact-form-project/
├── index.html
├── styles.css
├── script.js
└── README.md
```

## Running the Project

To run the project locally:

1. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser. You can do this by:
    - Double-clicking the file in your file explorer
    - Dragging and dropping the file into your browser window
    - Right-clicking the file and selecting "Open with" your preferred browser

2. The Contact Form should now be visible and functional in your browser.

## Making Adjustments

If you need to make any adjustments to the project:

1. Open the project folder in your preferred text editor or IDE.

2. To modify the form structure or content, edit the `index.html` file.

3. To change the styling of the form, edit the `styles.css` file.

4. To adjust the form validation or submission behavior, edit the `script.js` file.

5. After making changes, save the files and refresh the page in your browser to see the updates.

## Notes

- This project uses vanilla JavaScript and doesn't require any build tools or server setup.
- The form submission is currently set up to log data to the console and display a success message. In a real-world scenario, you would typically send this data to a server.
- To integrate this form with a backend:
    1. Set up a server endpoint to receive the form data.
    2. In the `script.js` file, modify the form submission logic to send data to your server endpoint (e.g., using `fetch` or `XMLHttpRequest`).

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

- Ensure all files (`index.html`, `styles.css`, `script.js`) are in the same directory.
- Check your browser's console for any JavaScript errors.
- Verify that you're using a modern, up-to-date web browser.
